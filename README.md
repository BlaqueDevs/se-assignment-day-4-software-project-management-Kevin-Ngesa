# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
1. Importance of Timely Delivery & Ensuring Deadlines Are Met
Timely delivery is crucial because it:

Maintains client trust and satisfaction.

Prevents budget overruns due to extended development time.

Helps meet market demands before competitors.

Avoids resource exhaustion and burnout.

Strategies to Ensure Deadlines Are Met:

Define Clear Milestones: Break the project into manageable tasks.

Use Agile Methodologies: Frequent iterations keep development on track.

Implement Risk Management: Identify and mitigate risks early.

Utilize Project Management Tools: Tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana help in tracking progress.

Regular Standups & Progress Reviews: Keep communication open within the team.

2. Importance of Cost Control & Budget Management Strategies
Effective cost control ensures:

The project remains financially viable.

Resources are used efficiently.

The project delivers value for money.

Strategies to Prevent Budget Overruns:

Detailed Budget Planning: Allocate costs for development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Scope Management: Avoid unnecessary features that inflate costs.

Monitor Expenses Regularly: Use budgeting tools like Microsoft Project or Monday.com.

Outsource Where Necessary: Reduce costs by outsourcing non-core functionalities.

3. Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies
Feature	Agile	Waterfall
Flexibility	Highly flexible; changes can be made anytime.	Rigid; changes are costly and difficult.
Project Phases	Iterative, with continuous improvement.	Linear, with clearly defined stages.
Customer Involvement	High involvement with regular feedback.	Minimal involvement after initial requirements.
Risk Management	Easier to adapt to risks.	High risk if an error is found late.
Delivery	Working software is delivered frequently.	Delivered at the end of the project.
Advantages of Agile:

Faster time to market.

More responsive to customer needs.

Encourages teamwork and innovation.

Disadvantages of Agile:

Requires more coordination.

Can lead to scope creep.

Advantages of Waterfall:

Clear structure and documentation.

Works well for projects with fixed requirements.

Disadvantages of Waterfall:

Late discovery of problems.

Not adaptable to changing needs.

4. When to Use Agile vs. Waterfall
Agile is better for:

Software with rapidly changing requirements (e.g., mobile apps, SaaS products).

Startups and experimental projects.

Customer-focused applications needing frequent updates.

Example:

Developing a fintech app where new regulations or user needs change frequently.

Waterfall is better for:

Well-defined projects with fixed requirements (e.g., banking systems, government projects).

Safety-critical applications where thorough testing is required.

Example:

Building an air traffic control system, where every requirement must be well-planned and tested.

5. Ensuring Quality Assurance in Software Projects
Methods for QA:

Automated & Manual Testing: Use Selenium, Jest, or Cypress for automation.

Code Reviews: Ensure peer review of all code changes.

Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD): Automated pipelines for frequent testing.

User Testing: Gather feedback from real users before full release.

Importance:

Prevents costly post-launch fixes.

Enhances user satisfaction.

Reduces security risks.

6. Project Scope & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Defining Project Scope:

Clearly outlines what is included and excluded in the project.

Prevents scope creep and budget overruns.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):

A hierarchical breakdown of tasks within a project.

Divides the project into smaller, manageable parts.

Why is WBS Useful?

Improves resource allocation.

Enhances task tracking and accountability.

Helps estimate costs and timelines accurately.

7. Benefits of a Project Schedule & Gantt Charts
Why is a Project Schedule Important?

Ensures timely execution of tasks.

Improves team coordination.

Helps in tracking project progress.

How Gantt Charts Help:

Visual representation of project timelines.

Clearly shows task dependencies.

Helps in identifying bottlenecks early.

Example:

A Gantt chart for a software project can map out design, development, testing, and deployment phases.

8. Core Issues Addressed by the Software
The software should solve real problems faced by users.
Examples of core issues:

Inefficient manual processes.

Poor customer experience.

Security vulnerabilities.

For Luku254 (your boutique management system):

Automates order tracking.

Simplifies payment processing.

Provides sales analytics for better decision-making.

9. Importance of Clearly Defining the Problem
Why?

Helps in designing the right features.

Ensures the solution aligns with user needs.

Prevents unnecessary development efforts.

Example:

Instead of saying "Users struggle with payments," define the problem as:

"Many boutique owners lack an integrated, secure, and automated payment system, leading to delayed transactions and lost sales."

10. Non-Technical Description of the Software Solution
online boutique management platform that helps small-scale fashion businesses manage inventory, sales, and payments effortlessly.

offers real-time sales tracking, automated financial reports, and M-Pesa payment integration, making it easy for business owners to focus on growth.

11. Key Features That Make the Software Stand Out
M-Pesa STK Push Integration – Secure and instant payments.

Automated Sales & Profit Reports – Tracks financial performance.

Order Management System – Keeps track of stock and customer orders.

User-friendly Dashboard – Simplifies business operations.

Secure Cloud-Based Storage – Ensures data safety.

12. Market Size & Growth Potential
Understanding market size helps determine business viability.


Sources:

Government business statistics.

Industry reports.

Market surveys.

13. How Market Trends Inform Software Development
Why it’s important:

Aligns the software with current industry needs.

Helps in feature prioritization.

Identifies emerging competitors and how to differentiate.
